## Doctor Web
Led a team of Seven members to develop and launch Doctor Web, a web-based application that connects patients with the right doctor and offers a range of other features to facilitate the healthcare process. As a front-end developer, I was responsible for designing and developing 12 pages of the application, using HTML, CSS, and JS. Additionally, as a team leader, I coordinated the team's efforts, delegated tasks, provided guidance and support, and ensured the project's success. Our project received full marks and a bonus from the TA, demonstrating our team's dedication and ability to deliver high-quality work. This experience allowed me to develop my skills in front-end development, project management, team leadership, communication, and problem-solving.
